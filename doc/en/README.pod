=item B<-help>

Prints help message on usage.

=item B<-neko>,  B<-tora>,  B<-dog>, B<-bsd>, B<-bsd_daemon>, B<-sakura>, B<-tomoyo>

Legacy options compatible with the original oneko.
A pet is selected without creating a new window.

=item B<-time> I<interval>

Sets interval timer which determine intervals for cat animation.
Default value is 125000 and unit is micro-second.  Smaller value makes cat
run faster.

=item B<-sleeptime> I<time>",
Set a delay between the first movement of the focus and the wakeup event.

=item B<-speed> I<distance>

Specify the distance where the cat jumps at one move in dot resolution.
The default is 16.

=item B<-idle> I<speed>

Specify the speed threshold to wake cat up when mouse is running away.

=item B<-name> I<name>

Specify the window name of the cat.

=item B<-towindow>

When I<oneko> starts with this option, you must select a window by the cursor.
Then cat appears and starts chasing the window instead of a mouse.  You can
select another running I<oneko> as the target window.  If root window is
selected, cat chases mouse as usually.  When the target window is not in sight
and not closed, cat chases mouse as usually.  If the target window is closed,
this program exits.

=item B<-toname> I<name>

Specify the window name of the target to make cat chase it instead of a mouse.
You can specify another running I<oneko> as the target window.  When the target
window is not in sight and not closed, cat chases mouse as usually.  If the
target window is closed, this program exits.

=item B<-tofocus>

Makes cat run to and on top of focus window.  When focus window is not in sight,
cat chases mouse as usually.
